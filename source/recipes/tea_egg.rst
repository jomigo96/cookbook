Steps
^^^^^

Get a large pot of boiling water, add the eggs and boil for 5 minutes.
Immediately remove the eggs to a cold bath.
Add all of the rest of the ingredients back to the pot and simmer.

Smack the eggs with the blunt side of a spoon, forming cracks all around.
Add them back to the pot, and simmer for 30 minutes.

Cut the heat, and leave it steeping overnight, then peel the eggs and fridge them.

.. note::
   The eggs can be simmered basically indefinitely, go crazy.

Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Minced :term:`pork <Pork>`
* 1 large :term:`Onion`
* :term:`Rice`
* 1 :term:`Lime`
* :term:`Lettuce`, optional
* :term:`Cilantro`, optional

Steps
^^^^^

On a dry frying pan, toast some rice until fully brown, then set it aside to cool.
Then, grind it to a powder using a wand or a mortar and pestle.
It should not be too fine, just enough for it to not get stuck in your teeth.

Start cooking plain white rice.

Fry the minced pork in some vegetable oil.
A stainless steel frying pan is recommended.
Break it apart very well, and season it liberally with salt.
There's no need to brown the meat too much, the flavour will come from the toasted rice.

When fully cooked, add all the seasonings: the toasted rice, a lot of chilly powder, pepper, optionally a bit of cumin
and coriander seeds.
Stir it for a couple of minutes.

Turn the heat to a minimum and add the diced onion, the lime juice, and the cilantro.
Combine everything for a few minutes, until all the water evaporates, the onion should be pretty raw.

Serve on top of lettuce leaves, such that you can grab and eat it like a taco, and rice on the side.

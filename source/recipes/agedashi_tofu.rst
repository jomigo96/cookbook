Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Firm :term:`Tofu`
* Potato starch, replaceable with corn starch or similar
* :term:`Dashi`
* :term:`Soy Sauce`
* :term:`Mirin`
* :term:`Green Onion`

Steps
^^^^^

**For the sauce**

Add two tablespoons of mirin to a pot, and boil it for a couple of minutes to evaporate the alcohol.
Add around 300ml of dashi stock, or dashi powder and water, two tablespoons of soy sauce, and bring it to a boil.
Take it off the heat while waiting for the tofu.

**For the tofu**

Dry the tofu thoroughly, by either freezing it or putting it under a weight for a while.
Cut it into large pieces, like 6 for a whole block.
Dry it thoroughly with paper towels.

Coat the tofu in the starch on all sides and remove any excess.
Deep fry it in very hot oil until it is light brown all around.

.. warning::
   It's full of water, don't burn yourself.

Take it out and let it drain on a wire rack or paper towels.

Serve in a bowl half filled with sauce, and garnish with the green part of a green onion.
Other common toppings are daikon radish and bonito flakes.

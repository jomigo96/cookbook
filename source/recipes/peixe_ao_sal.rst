Peixe ao sal
------------

*Fish baked in salt*

:term:`Medium`, :term:`One Pot` (technically)

Source: Eduardo

Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

* A medium to big fresh, whole :term:`Fish`. Something like snook, bream, or flounder. My preferred one is *dourada*, "gilt-head bream". It may be gutted, but it **must not** be scaled.
* 1 or 2 Kg of coarse salt

Steps
^^^^^

Take a fish and place it on an oven tray, completely covered in salt on all sides.
Really, like a 0.5cm layer all around, you should not be able to see any of the fish.
Press it lightly.

Pre-heat the oven at 200Â°C  and bake for about half an hour.
Yes, that's it, just don't eat the skin.

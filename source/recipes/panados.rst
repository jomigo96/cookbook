Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

* :term:`Pork`, lean part cut into thin steaks. It's possible to use a meat hammer
* :term:`Egg`
* :term:`Flour`
* :term:`Bread crumbs`
* :term:`Lemon`

Steps
^^^^^

Prepare the standard breading setup, with flour, bread crumbs and a beat egg in 3 bowls.

Season the meat with salt.
Coat it with flour, egg, then bread crumbs in this order.

.. tip::
   Use one hand for the dry parts and another for the wet part.

Deep fry it in vegetable oil until golden, or, more practical, pan fry it on both sides with plenty of oil.
Lay it to rest on a wire rack or kitchen towels.

Squeeze some lemon juice on top and serve.

It lasts in the fridge for a week, goes well in sandwiches or with some tomato rice.
For freezing, the best option is to freeze it before frying, but you may also fry twice.

Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Glutinous rice :term:`flour`
* :term:`Sugar`
* Silken :term:`tofu`

And you should also get some skewer sticks.
Some flavorings, optional:

* Black :term:`sesame seeds`
* :term:`Matcha` powder
* Strawberry powder


Steps
^^^^^

Form the dough with your hands.
Approximately, use the same weight in flour as in tofu, and not a lot of sugar.
For example, 200g tofu, 200g flour, 20g sugar.
Adjust as needed depending on how wet the tofu is, it should be very soft but hold its shape well.

If you are adding any flavors, divide the dough in multiple parts.

For the sesame flavor, first toast the seeds on a dry frying pan, then crush or grind them.
Use more than you think you need.
Combine it well in the dough.

Form the dough into ~20g balls and boil them them in water, careful to not let it stick to the bottom.
When it floats, splash some cold water, then once it boils again it's ready.

Stick them on skewers.

You can make a glaze with soy sauce, water, sugar and potato starch, cooking until thick.
I prefer to add red bean paste or some other jam.

* :term:`Chicken` wings

Steps
^^^^^

Cut the vegetables, except the onion, into medium sized pieces and boil until soft.

On a stainless steel pot or pan, place the chicken skin side down with a bit of vegetable oil.
Fry in medium high heat without moving.
Let it form a brown crust, until it unsticks on its own.

Remove the chicken, let the pot cool a bit, then add onions cut into half moon slices, and fry for a few minutes.
De-glaze with water, add back the chicken, the boiled vegetables, and the curry cube broken into chunks.
Add a bit of salt if necessary, pepper, optionally chilli powder, and let it boil on low heat for 10 minutes.

Serve with plain rice.

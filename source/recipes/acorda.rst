Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Stale :term:`Bread`, any fresh wheat bread that is a day old, but never sweet kinds
* :term:`Garlic`
* :term:`Cilantro`
* :term:`Egg`

Any *toppings*, optional in any combination

* Ripe :term:`Tomato`
* :term:`Shrimp`, or another kind of soft seafood cut into small pieces, like leftover cod

Steps
^^^^^

Slice the bread into bite sized pieces, place into a bowl and pour some water to soak it.
It should not be submerged, but there should be a little water in the bottom.

Finely chop the garlic, and place in a large pot with high quality olive oil.
Fry until fragrant.

If using tomato, remove the skin, dice, and add to the pot, cooking in low heat until it starts to thicken.

Add the bread, half the herbs, and the remaining toppings.
Season with a bit of salt (remember the bread doesn't need any), and a splash of acidity, like lemon juice or vinegar.

Stir it for around 5 minutes, waiting for everything to form into a paste, and adding water as necessary.

Beat an egg yolk.
Turn off the heat and add the egg and the rest of the herbs, mixing quickly.

.. tip::
   Another alternative to mixing in the egg is to serve a poached egg on top.

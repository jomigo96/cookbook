Chicken bolognese
-----------------

.. warning::
   Do not read if you are Italian.

:term:`Medium`, :term:`Leftovers`, :term:`Freezes`.

My slightly healthier take on bolognese.
The biggest difference, apart from the chicken, is that I don't use any cream or cheese on the sauce.
Shred some cheese on top if you will, but I like the simple tomato based sauce.


Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

For around 3 servings

* 400 grams of minced :term:`chicken`
* 1 or 2 large :term:`onions <onion>`
* :term:`Garlic`
* A can of :term:`tomato`, or 2-3 ripe ones.

Optionally,

* :term:`Carrot`
* :term:`Bell pepper`
* :term:`Mushroom`

Steps
^^^^^

Dice the onion coarsely, and fry it in olive oil on medium heat, adding a pinch of salt to draw out some moisture.
At this point, if using any of the optional vegetables, chop them very thinly and add them in too with a bit more salt.
For carrots, shred them with a hand box grater.

When the onion is fully soft, move everything to the cold edges of the pan (or set aside), and add the meat.
Turn the heat to high, press it down, and let it brown a bit without stirring.

Add in the full tomato can and minced garlic.
Simmer it on low heat for a total of 20 minutes and up to 45, meanwhile breaking apart the tomato and meat with your spatula.
Adjust the seasoning with salt, pepper, and sugar.
Keep it quite wet all the time, using cheap wine or pasta water.
Let it thicken a bit towards the end.

Serve on top of some pasta.

.. tip::
   For reheating, cook the pasta, drain it, then add the sauce to the pot and heat it on the stove.

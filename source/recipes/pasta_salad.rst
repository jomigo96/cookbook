Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Small shaped :term:`pasta`, penne, fusili, or farfalle
* :term:`Cucumber`
* :term:`Tomato`, a firm variety
* :term:`Chickpeas`, canned or pre-cooked
* :term:`Lemon` juice or good :term:`vinegar`

And many optional “toppings”

* :term:`Cheese` chunks
* Boiled :term:`Egg`
* Herbs, like :term:`Basil`


Steps
^^^^^

After boiling the pasta, drain it and let it sit a few minutes to dry up.

Cut everything into bite-sized pieces, and throw it in a big bowl.
Make a vinagrette with 3 tablespoons of olive oil, one tablespoon of lemon juice, a pinch of sugar or honey, and some salt.

.. note::
   The chickpeas, pasta, and cheese are already salty, add only a bit considering the raw vegetables.

Toss everything together and serve either as is or let it chill first.

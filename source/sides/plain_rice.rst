Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

* White :term:`Rice`

Steps
^^^^^

Bring 2 parts water to a boil in a pot.
Throw in 1 part rice and cover with the lid.
After a minute, stir it a bit and break up any clumps.

.. note::
   Whether you add any salt depends on the kind of food you are having.
   If it's asian food or something saucy, I add none.

Add the lid, put the heat on minimum, and cook for around 10 minutes, or until there is no more water visible.
Turn off the heat, and let it steam for at least 5 minutes with the lid on.

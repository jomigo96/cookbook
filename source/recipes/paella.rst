Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Paprika to replace saffron. Or saffron if you are rich.
* :term:`Rice`, risotto works best
* Red :term:`Bell pepper`
* Optionally, :term:`Green beans` or :term:`Peas`
* A large :term:`Onion`
* :term:`Garlic`
* Some meat, dark :term:`chicken` with the skin is best, or :term:`shrimp`.

Steps
^^^^^

On a large frying pan, sear the chicken skin side down on high heat, until there is a good amount of browning.
Set it aside.

Dice the onion, garlic, and bell pepper, and fry them in the meat fat, adding a generous splash of olive oil too.
De-glaze with some white wine or beer (or water).

Add the rice and about 3 parts of water and stir well.
Season with salt, black pepper, the paprika, and optionally with smoked paprika, chilly powder, and a bit of sugar.

Cook for about 20 minutes until the rice is done.
Add the meat back about 5 minutes from done, and the green vegetables also a few minutes before, depending on how much cooking they need.
You may need to add a lot more water depending on the kind of rice you use.

Turn the heat to high, and do not mix anymore.
The goal is to slightly burn the bottom layer of rice, but this can be very hard.
You are safe while there is a lot of steam coming out, but afterwards use your nose.

Take it off the heat and let it rest 10 minutes before serving.

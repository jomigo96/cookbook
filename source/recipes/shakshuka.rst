Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

* :term:`Onion`
* :term:`Garlic`
* A large can of :term:`tomatoes <tomato>`
* 2 :term:`eggs <egg>` per serving
* Red :term:`bell pepper`, optional
* :term:`Cilantro`, optional

Steps
^^^^^

Use a large stainless steel frying pan, dice the onions and fry in olive oil with a pinch of salt, until very soft.
Lower the heat and add some minced garlic, combine for 2 minutes.

Add the can of tomatoes, a splash of white wine, salt and pepper, let it simmer for at least 10 minutes.
Split the tomatoes a bit if they are too big, but don't turn it into a mush.
The essential spices are cumin, paprika (smoked ok), and cayenne pepper, use a generous amount.

.. note::
   It's possible to add more vegetables, red bell pepper being the most traditional.
   Some kinds of squash, zuchini or even brussel sprouts are also possible.

Make a dimple in the sauce and crack in the eggs.
Add the herbs on top and cover with a lid, until the whites are almost fully set, it will finish cooking as you
prepare to serve.

I recommend to have it with :ref:`couscous`.

Steps
^^^^^

If using dried beans, pre-soak them overnight, then boil in lightly salted water until al-dente.
Depending on the type of beans, usually 45 minutes.

Sweat diced onion in olive oil for a few minutes, then add minced garlic.
Optionally, also some sliced chilly pepper.
Throw in the pork and turn the heat to high, until all grey.
Add a bit of tomato paste and/or the diced tomato, continue frying, then de-glaze with water or stock.

Season it with salt, pepper, thyme, parsley, and a whole chunk of star anise that you must fish-out later.
Simmer for 30 minutes.

Add the beans back, and continue simmering until the bean texture is up to your liking.
Splash a bit of vinegar at the end.

.. tip::
   The liquid will thicken substancially when you take it off the heat.

Serve with white rice.

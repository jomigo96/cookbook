Alho francês à Brás
-------------------------------------

:term:`Medium`, :term:`One Pot`, :term:`Leftovers`, :term:`Vegetarian`

A vegetarian version of a very popular Portuguese dish, replacing cod with leek.

Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

* *Batata-palha* (straw potato), chips that are shaped like thin sticks, usually only available in Portuguese stores
* :term:`Parsley`
* A very large :term:`Leek`
* 1 :term:`Egg` per serving.
* :term:`Olives`, black ones without the pit, but any kind works

Steps
^^^^^

Chop the leek, cutting it in half longitudinally then into 5mm strips across.
Fry it in olive oil until mostly soft.

.. warning::
   The potato chips are usually very salty and greasy.
   Don't add any salt, and be conservative with the oil.

Add the potatoes.
Mix thoroughly and wait for the potatoes to soften up a bit.
You may need to add some liquid depending on how much moisture there is (say, a tablespoon of water).
Add pepper and chopped parsley leaves, and some olives.

Turn off the heat, add the beat eggs and mix quickly, letting the residual heat cook the eggs.
It should still have a runny consistency.

.. tip::
   If saving leftovers, don't add the egg.
   Do the last step the next day.

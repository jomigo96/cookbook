:term:`Easy`, :term:`One Pot`

Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Sashimi-grade :term:`Fish`.
* 2 :term:`limes <Lime>`
* Red :term:`onion <Onion>`
* :term:`Cilantro` 

Optional toppings:

* :term:`Tomato`
* :term:`Avocado` 
* :term:`Jalape√±o` 

Steps
^^^^^

For the toppings, chop everything into bite-sized pieces.

Cut the fish into 2cm pieces, dice the onion and cilantro, and place them into a glass container.
Mix with salt, olive oil, and plenty of lime juice.
Cover, and let it "cook" in the fridge for 5 to 10 minutes.

Mix with the rest of the toppings and serve immediately.

.. note::
   If the toppings are reasonably dry (i.e. no fresh tomato), then you can prepare everything together.
   Otherwise, it can dilute the acid.

It works well with rice, bread, tortilla.

.. tip::
   For keeping as leftovers, don't add the lime juice, do that before eating.

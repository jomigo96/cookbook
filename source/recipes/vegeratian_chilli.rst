:term:`Easy`, :term:`Leftovers`, :term:`Freezes`, :term:`Vegetarian`

Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

* One large can of :term:`black beans <Beans>`
* One medium can of small :term:`red beans <Beans>`. Kidney beans are fine
* One large can of :term:`Tomatoes <Tomato>`
* :term:`Onion`
* :term:`Garlic`
* :term:`Ginger`

.. hint::
    Fresh or dry beans are possible, just prepare them beforehand.

Steps
^^^^^

Take a large pot and fry the ginger, onion and garlic in olive oil, diced into medium pieces.
Add the whole can of tomatoes.
Season with salt, a bay leaf, a couple pieces of star anise, smoked paprika, a bit of oregano, chilli powder, and a
bit of white wine.
Let it simmer for 5 minutes.

Rinse the beans thoroughly and add them to the pot.
Add water to just cover the beans and cook for up to 30 minutes.

Take out 20% of the stew and smash the beans open, then pour it back in.
Using the bottom of a glass on the pot directly is fine, just be careful to not overdo it.
Adjust the seasoning, it should be quite spicy.
Fish out the star anise, and splash a bit of vinegar.

Serve as is with some soft cheese on top, or over rice or quinoa.

.. tip::
    Before reheating, add a bit of water.

Bacon cabbage
-------------

:term:`Easy`

A lazy keto favorite.

Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Half of a :term:`Cabbage` head
* :term:`Bacon`

Steps
^^^^^

Chop the cabbage into medium pieces and steam them for 10 minutes.

In the meantime fry the bacon on a pan, starting it cold.
Render out as much fat as possible.

When the bacon is at the desirable level, add the cabbage and stir it around to get rid of the water and coat everything in fat.
If there isn't enough, add a bit of olive oil.
Season with black pepper and salt, but not too much depending on how salty the bacon is.

Roasted chicken with potatoes
-----------------------------

:term:`Easy`, :term:`Leftovers`, :term:`One pot`

Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

* :term:`Chicken`, dark meat pieces like wings, thighs, drumsticks
* :term:`Onion`
* :term:`Potatoes <Potato>`, the small round ones are preferable

Steps
^^^^^

Slice the onion into circles, and place in the bottom of an oven tray.
Add the potatoes, skin on, cutting into ~5cm pieces if using large ones.

Season the chicken with salt and pepper, and place skin down in the tray.
Drizzle some olive oil and add some fresh herbs if desired.
Bake at 200C for 15 minutes.

Flip things around, this time leaving the skin up.
Add some salt to the potatoes at this point.

Bake until the skin is crispy, around half an hour.

Serve with rice, if you don't have enough potatoes, using the roast liquid as sauce.

Notes
^^^^^

You may add any other vegetables as well, just don't overcook them.
Sweet pepper, asparagus or brussel sprouts work well, and carrots can replace some of the potatoes.

Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

* 2 or 3 :term:`Eggs <Egg>`
* Leftover :term:`Rice`, brown is ok
* Some kind of :term:`Onion`
* Any vegetable, like :term:`peas` of :term:`carrots <Carrot>`

Steps
^^^^^

Add a tablespoon of oil to a non-stick frying pan and turn the heat to high.
Crack in the eggs, and quickly stir them with chopsticks, until mostly but not fully scrambled.
Fry on high until starting to brown, then set aside and split into chunks with a spatula or knife.

Add a bit more oil, a good one here is coconut oil, and fry the thinly chopped onion, and any other aromatics.
When it starts to brown, toss in the rice and fry on high for a few minutes.
Lower the heat and add any vegetable that needs cooking.

Season with light soy sauce, pepper, chilly flakes if you want it spicy, and a pinch of sugar.
Add back the egg and anything that doesn't need cooking (like frozen peas).

:term:`Easy`

Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

* :term:`Canned tuna`
* :term:`Onion`
* :term:`Garlic`
* :term:`Chilli pepper`
* :term:`Tomato`
* :term:`Pasta`

Steps
^^^^^

Boil the pasta separately.

Dice onions and chillies, and fry in olive oil with a pinch of salt.
When all soft, add garlic and fry for a minute.
Add the canned tuna and fry in high heat until all the moisture is gone.

Optionally, add a bit of tomato paste, mixing well to get a bit of that sugar browning while it is dry.
Add the diced tomato.
Season with black pepper, smoked paprika, a bit of fish sauce, chilli powder if you are feeling brave.
Let it simmer for up to half an hour, and a minimum of 5 minutes.

Keep it reasonably moist with pasta water.
Alternatively, you can replace it with a "tea" of fennel seeds.
Also at this stage you may need to add sugar to balance the tomato acidity.

Combine the pasta with the sauce, or serve the sauce over pasta, both work.

Steps

Butterfly the chicken into thin steaks.
You can pound it too, but it's unecessary.

Juice the limes, chop the garlic, and prepare the marinade with all the listed ingredients.
Throw everything into a zip bag and let it set in the fridge for 1-4 hours.

Drain the excess sauce, and fry in a very hot pan with a little oil, until it just starts to brown on each side.

Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

* A large :term:`Eggplant`
* 2-3 tablespoons of :term:`Miso paste`
* 3-4 cloves of minced :term:`Garlic`
* 1 tablespoon of :term:`Sesame oil`
* 2 tablespoons of :term:`Soy sauce`
* :term:`Sugar` (depends on the brand of miso)

Strongly recommended for garnishing:

* :term:`Sesame seeds`
* :term:`Green onion` greens


Steps
^^^^^

Slice the eggplant into relatively thick (2cm) slices.
Score them on both sides to make a grid-like pattern, being careful to make it differently on both sides so that it doesn't fall apart.

Fry the eggplant in some vegetable oil on both sides, until light brown.

In the meantime, prepare the sauce with the remaining ingredients, thinning it out with some warm water until everything is well mixed.

Turn the heat to minimum, and pour the sauce in the eggplant, cooking it for 2 more minutes on each side.
Sprinkle the sesame seeds and green onion, and serve with some rice.

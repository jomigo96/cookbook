:term:`Easy`, :term:`One Pot`, :term:`Vegetarian`

Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Soft :term:`Tofu` (not silken)
* :term:`Pasta`, penne or fusilli
* :term:`Garlic`
* :term:`Curry cube mix`

For the vegetables, there are a lot of possibilities, I usually use a combination of:

* :term:`Carrot`
* :term:`Green beans`
* :term:`Potato`
* :term:`Mushroom`

Steps
^^^^^

Cut all the vegetables and tofu into medium sized pieces.

Start boiling the pasta, but use less salt than usual.
Any hard vegetables — like the carrots, potatoes, and green beans — can be boiled together in the pasta water.
Add a whole crushed garlic clove too.
Boil for around 2 minutes less than the pasta package says.

Drain some water, leave around 2cm in the bottom.
Add the rest of the vegetables and the curry cube, cut into small chunks to help it dissolve.
Keep mixing until all the curry is dissolved, adding water as necessary.
Boil in low heat until all the vegetables are soft.
It's ok if the pasta is overcooked.

Optionally, add a tiny bit of dark soy sauce, miso paste, and chilly flakes.

Add the tofu and mix very carefully, then let it get hot for a couple of minutes and serve.

Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

* :term:`Canned tuna`
* :term:`Garlic`
* :term:`Tomato pulp`, alternatively real, ripe :term:`Tomato`, or canned
* :term:`Pasta`

Steps
^^^^^

Boil the pasta separately.

Dice 2 to 3 cloves of garlic, and fry it in olive oil.
Add the drained tuna, and turn up the heat.
The goal is to brown the tuna a bit, but being careful not to burn the garlic.
Season with **a lot** of black pepper.

Add the tomato pulp or diced tomato, and simmer for 5 minutes until relatively thick.
Season with salt, pepper and dried oregano.

Serve the sauce over pasta.
Top with a bit more olive oil and oregano.

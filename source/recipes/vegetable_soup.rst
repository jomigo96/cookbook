Vegetable soup
--------------

:term:`Easy`, :term:`Leftovers`, :term:`Vegetarian`

It's literally normal - if a bit pungent - soup.

Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

I always use these:

* White :term:`Onion`
* :term:`Garlic`
* :term:`Cabbage`,

and an arbitrary combination of these:

* :term:`Potato`
* :term:`Turnip`
* :term:`Carrot`
* :term:`Leek`
* :term:`Celery`.

Steps
^^^^^

Roughly cut all the vegetables into pieces around 3cm, so that they cook evenly.

Add everything to a large pot, cover with water and season liberally with salt.
I usually use a steamer pot, cooking the main vegetables in the bottom and steaming the rest.

For the cabbage leaves or other “toppings” of your choice, cut them into smaller, bite-sized pieces.

Simmer for around 45 minutes.
Adjust the seasoning, adding 4 tablespoons of olive oil, pepper to taste, and optionally dry basil.
Blend everything using an immersion blender until very smooth.
Mix the steamed vegetables into the soup.

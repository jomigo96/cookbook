Onigiri
-------

:term:`Medium`, :term:`Leftovers`

Source: :cite:cts:`taiji:onigiri`

Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

* :term:`Rice`, a good replacement for the specific Japanese kind is **risotto** rice
* :term:`Nori` sheets

Fillings
^^^^^^^^

One option is plain onigiri with salt on the outside.

For fillings, use some kind of fish and a thick sauce.
The classic is :term:`tuna` - :term:`mayo`.

Some other options:

* Seared :term:`Salmon` and :term:`siracha`
* Cooked :term:`Salmon` and :term:`kimchi`
* Seaweed in :term:`soy sauce` is my favorite from the combini

Steps
^^^^^

Cook the rice with no salt, according to the package instructions.
Lay it flat on a plate to completely cool and dry a bit.

Prepare the fillings and get a bowl of water and a bowl of salt.

Wet your hands to prevent sticking when grabbing the rice.
Form the rice balls with the filling, check :cite:labelpar:`taiji:onigiri` for the technique, or use a special onigiri
mold.

Optionally, rub a bit of salt on the outside.
Not optional if making plain onigiri.

If the seaweed comes in a sealed bag, use it to wrap the onigiri just before eating in order to preserve the
crunchiness.

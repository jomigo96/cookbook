Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

For 2 portions:

* :term:`Chicken` breast
* :term:`Mushroom`
* one :term:`Onion`
* some :term:`Garlic`
* 100-200ml of :term:`cream`
* 1-2 tablespoons of :term:`Mustard`
* 1 tablespoon of :term:`Ketchup`

Steps
^^^^^

Preheat a pan and sear the chicken until golden brown on both sides.
Set aside and let the pan cool a bit.

Sauté a diced onion and garlic for a few minutes, then add the mushrooms, sliced.
Cook slowly until the mushrooms are done, with some salt so they release more moisture.
Deglaze the pan with white wine.

.. note::
   If the meat fond is burning, deglaze earlier.

Slice the meat into bite sized pieces then add it back to the pan.
Add all the sauces, salt and pepper to taste, and let the meat finish cooking for a few minutes on low heat.

Optionally, season with some :term:`nutmeg`.
Some people add :term:`flour` to thicken the sauce too.
I usually add some steamed :term:`broccoli` too, cut into little pieces.

Serve with either pasta or white rice.

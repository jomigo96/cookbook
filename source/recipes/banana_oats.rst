Steps
^^^^^

Measure some oats, and bring 1.5-2 times the volume of water to a boil in a small pot.
2 parts of water will make it very soft and runny, 1.5 is more conventional.

Roughly cut the banana into bite-sized pieces and add it to the water.
After it boils, throw in the oats, as well as a pinch of salt.

Stir everything occasionally.
It's done when there's only about 1mm of water on top, it will thicken as it cools.
Sprinkle a bit of cinnamon, mix, and serve on a bowl.

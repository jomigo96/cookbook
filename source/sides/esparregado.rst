If using raw spinach, blanch it for a minute, drain it, then chop it very thinly.

Finely chop garlic and fry in some olive oil until fragrant.
Add the spinach, milk to almost submerge it, and cook until there is no liquid milk visible anymore.

Meanwhile, season with pepper, lemon zest and juice (if using) **or** vinegar.

Add around two tablespoons of tapioca flour, mixing well.
Adjust with olive oil and water to get the right consistency, it should be a wet paste that's easy to eat with a fork.

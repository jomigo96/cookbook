:term:`Hard`, :term:`One pot`

A very comforting but strong flavoured chicken broth.
It takes a long time to make, and the smell will be all over your house.
Best enjoyed on a cold winter day.

Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Half of a :term:`chicken`. No need to cut it, unless to fit into the pot.
* 3 slices of :term:`ginger`
* 5 big pieces of :term:`green onion`
* Cooking wine and/or beer
* Any :term:`Mushroom`

Some special Chinese aromatics:

* ~7 red dates
* ~10 goji berries
* Dangshen (党参), very much optional

Steps
^^^^^

Wash the chicken (don't splash, be careful about salmonella).
This can be skipped depending on how cleanly the chicken is packaged.

On a large pot, throw in the ginger, dates, danshen, chicken, and submerge in water.
Boil it on strong heat, at first a lot of foam will form from the blood, skim it with a spoon.
Simmer it for 30 minutes.

Add the green onion, 3 spoons of cooking wine, an arbitrary amount of beer, and simmer it for another 30 minutes.

Add mushrooms, simmer another 30 minutes.

Add the goji, salt, and simmer another 30 minutes.

.. tip::
   You can reheat on the stove, it lasts a while.

Steps
^^^^^

For the meat sauce
""""""""""""""""""

If using beef, fry it in a hot stainless steel pot with some olive oil, trying to get some color.
Add the diced onion and garlic towards the end, and fry until most of the liquid evaporates.

Then, deglaze with a bit of white wine, add the tomato, seasonings (black pepper, salt, oregano), and simmer for about 30 minutes.
Get it quite thick, breaking apart the meat as much as possible.

If using chicken, fry the onions first, then add the chicken.

Assembling
""""""""""

If you have to, cut the lasagna sheets in a way that they fit exactly into your casserole, maybe two side-by-side.
Soak them in warm water while you prepare the rest.

Assemble the lasagna like pasta - meat sauce - pasta - béchamel and cheese - pasta - etc.
The last layer should be cheese.

Cover the casserole with aluminum foil, and bake at 190°C  for 45 minutes.
For the last 10 minutes, remove the cover and turn on the oven fan.

.. tip::
   You can freeze the whole casserole, and reheat it in the oven again.

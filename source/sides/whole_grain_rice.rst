Whole grain rice
----------------

Aka brown rice. Healthier.

Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Whole grain :term:`Rice`

Steps
^^^^^

For better results, soak the rice beforehand for an hour.
Bring a pot of water to a boil.
Add some salt, but not as much as you would for pasta.

Pour in the rice, stir a bit, and let it boil it for 20 to 30 minutes.
Taste for doneness.
I usually like :term:`al dente`.
Drain the water, then let it steam off the heat for at least 10 minutes.

.. note::
   The time to cook as well as whether soaking is necessary greatly depends on the brand of rice.
   Just taste it.

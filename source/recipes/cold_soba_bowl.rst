Chop the vegetables into thin strips.

Fry the egg, or prepare any other protein of you choice separately.

For the sauce, mince the garlic very thinly.
Add it to a bowl with 2-3 table spoons of light soy sauce, a table spoon of honey, half a table spoon of vinegar, half a table spoon of some neutral oil, some chilly flakes and the sesame seeds.
Mix well.

Boil the soba according to the package instructions, usually 4 minutes.
Drain it, then run it under cold water in a colander until it feels cold.

Assemble your bowl, place the soba, vegetables around, egg in the center, and drip the sauce on top.
Enjoy your garlic breath afterwards.

------------------

:term:`Medium`, :term:`Leftovers`, :term:`One pot`

Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

For two portions:

* :term:`Pork` belly
* 4 slices of :term:`Ginger`
* 4 large segments of :term:`Green onion`, the big kind, white part
* Around 10g of :term:`Sugar`
* A tablespoon of :term:`Soy sauce`
* 2-3 tablespoons of Chinese cooking wine

Optional aromatics are 

* :term:`Star anise`
* :term:`Cinnamon`
* :term:`Dry chilli` flakes, usually I only use this one


Steps
^^^^^

Cut the pork into quite large pieces, about the size of a finger.
Sear the meat in a large frying pan or wok, with medium low heat.
When light gray, remove the meat.

Add the sugar to the pan, heat it up slowly until it all melts and turns amber.
Add back the meat, ginger and green onion, and coat them thoroughly in the liquid.
After a couple of minutes on medium heat, de-glaze with the wine.

Add the soy sauce to the edges of the pan and the remaining aromatics.
Add enough hot water to cover the meat, then let it cook for 40 minutes and up to an hour.

Towards the end, increase the heat to evaporate the remaining liquid, and finish with some salt.
Serve with rice.

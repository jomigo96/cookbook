Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

* :term:`Canned tuna`
* :term:`Onion`
* :term:`Garlic`
* :term:`Tomato pulp`, alternatively real, ripe :term:`Tomato`, or canned
* :term:`Pasta`

Steps
^^^^^

Boil the pasta separately.

Dice onions and fry in olive oil, with a pinch of salt.
When all soft, add garlic and fry for a minute.
Add the tomato pulp or diced tomato.

Let it simmer for up to half an hour, and a minimum of 5 minutes.
Keep it reasonably moist with white wine or pasta water.
Season with pepper and dried oregano.

Two minutes before ready, add the drained tuna, and break it into small chunks, though not completely shredded.
Add the pasta to the sauce, using a bit of the pasta water if necessary to keep the sauce a bit liquidy.
Splash a little more olive oil and serve.

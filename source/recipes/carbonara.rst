Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

* :term:`Pasta`
* :term:`Bacon`, or another fatty, preserved pork cut
* :term:`Egg`
* :term:`Parmesan`
* :term:`Garlic`, optional

Steps
^^^^^

Boil the pasta separately while working on the next steps.
Cut the bacon into bite sized pieces and fry it on a large frying pan, starting it cold.
Add a little water once it starts sizzling to render out some fat, and add a little more olive oil if it's still too dry, or drain out the fat if it is too much.
Optionally, add a whole garlic clove.

Prepare the sauce on a bowl, consisting of one egg, a bit of olive oil, shredded parmesan, and **a lot** of black pepper.
Mix well with a fork.
If making for more than one person, try use 2 egg yolks to 1 full egg of a ratio, but don't bother if it's just for one person.

When the pasta is al-dente, drain it, reserving a bit of the water.
Add the pasta to the slightly crispy bacon, and turn off the heat.
Carefully add the sauce and mix immediately.
You need to be careful to not cook the eggs too much, make sure it has cooled a bit.
Add a bit of the pasta water, and serve once the consistency is at the desired level.

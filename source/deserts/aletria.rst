Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

For about 6 servings:

* 250g of vermicelli :term:`pasta` noodles, commonly sold specifically for aletria
* 110-180g of :term:`sugar`
* 3 :term:`egg` yolks
* :term:`cinnamon`, 1 stick and powder
* a 3cm strip of :term:`lemon` peel
* a tablespoon of :term:`butter`

.. note::
   Many recipes replace some of the water with milk.

Steps
^^^^^

To 1 liter of water, add the cinnamon stick, lemon peel, sugar, butter and a pinch of salt.
When it boils, add the noodles, and let it simmer on low until most of the water is absorbed.
Make sure the noodles are fully soft, otherwise add a bit more water and wait.

Remove the cinnamon and lemon and let it cool off the heat for 2 minutes.
Whisk the egg yolks and slowly pour them in, mixing thoroughly.

Spread the mixture in a shallow tray, and decorate with powdered cinnamon.
It can be eaten at room temperature or still warm, but you should wait for it to firm up.

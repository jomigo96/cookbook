Steps
^^^^^


Using a large frying pan and a bit of vegetable oil, fry the white part of a green onion and a diced tomato, preferably
without skin.
Add the dry shin ramen seasoning packet, and keep frying until the tomato falls apart, adding a bit of water if
necessary.

Add water and the white part of the cabbage cut into bite sized pieces, and boil for two minutes.
Optionally, further season with a tablespoon of soy sauce and half a tablespoon of Chinese black vinegar.

Add the dry noodles.
Keep pressing them down until they are all submerged in the liquid.
Make a dent and crack in an egg.
Distribute the shin ramen vegetable packet.
Let the egg cook, you may cover with a lid to steam it.

.. note::
   You may also fry the egg seperately instead of poaching it.
   There's also a lot of flexibility for adding other kinds of vegetables, even ground meat or tofu.

At the last minute, submerge the green cabbage leaves.
Dress with the green part of the green onion, and serve.

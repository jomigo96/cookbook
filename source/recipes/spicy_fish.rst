Spicy fish
----------

*At the time of writing, I haven't made this one in a few years so it could be way off.*

:term:`Medium`

Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

* White :term:`fish`
* :term:`Garlic`
* :term:`Ginger`
* Mandioca :term:`flour`
* A tablespoon of :term:`Doubanjiang`
* Dried chillies

Steps
^^^^^

Cut the fish into thin slices.
It's easier if it's a bit frozen.

Marinade it with white pepper, minced ginger, cooking wine, and some mandioca flour.

Get a small pan, fry the Doubanjiang and garlic for a few minutes.
Add a dollop of tomato paste, then water until you have a couple of centimeters.

Chop the chillies, add them to a bowl, and optionally you can add :term:`Sichuan pepper` corns too.
Get some very hot oil and pour it into the bowl.

.. note::

   You can skip this step altogether and just add the chillies to the broth.
   Or, fry them for a couple minutes on a different pan.

Add the fish to the broth, and simmer for a couple of minutes.
Add the chilly with the oil on top, and eat it hot-pot-style with some rice.

Ingredients
^^^^^^^^^^^

* :term:`Quinoa`. I like the mixed color kind.

Steps
^^^^^

Bring 2 parts water to a boil in a pot, as well as a bit of salt.
Throw in 1 part quinoa, stir well, then cover with the lid.

Cook on minimum for around 15 minutes, or until most of them pop open.
Turn off the heat, fluff it with a fork, and let it steam for 10 minutes with the lid on.
